## Introduction

Welcome to Vibecard. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of **vibecard.co.uk** (the “Site”) and the purchase of products and services offered by Vibecard (“we”, “us”, “our”). By using our Site or placing an order, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.

## About Us

## Our Service

Vibecard allows you to submit prompts that generate an **AI-created image** (the “Artwork”).
When you place an order, we will produce your Artwork and send it to you printed on a physical postcard (the “Postcard”), posted free of charge.

- The **Artwork** is the product you are purchasing.
- The **Postcard** is provided free of charge as the means of delivery.
- Delivery is usually expected within **4–6 working days**, but times may vary.

## Eligibility

- You must be **18 years or older** to use this service.
- The service is available only to customers in the **United Kingdom**.

## Orders & Payment

- By placing an order, you agree to pay the price displayed at checkout.

## Free Postcards

**Note:**

- When you register for a new account, you receive **one free Artwork and Postcard**.
- For each paid order, you receive **one additional free Artwork and Postcard**. The free Postcard is tied to your order and cannot be carried over.

## Refunds & Cancellations

- You may not resell or commercially exploit the Artwork without written consent.
